Croogo comes with a Translate plugin. Activating it from Extensions > Plugins page will allow you to translate your content in other languages.

By default, it supports translations for Nodes, Blocks and Links. You can add more by editing /app/plugins/translate/config/translate_bootstrap.php file.

When you go to index pages of, for example, Nodes (Content > List), you will notice a `Translate` button for each item.

Languages
=========

Before you can start translating your content, you need to let Croogo know about other languages that you wish your content to be translated to. You can manage them from Settings > Languages page.
