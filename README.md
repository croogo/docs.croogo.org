# Build files of Croogo Documentation

This repository is intended to contain the files to be hosted at http://docs.croogo.org

If you want to update documentation, please fork the original `docs` repository at https://github.com/croogo/docs.

## Structure

Build files should go to their respective directories based on Croogo's version.

Latest version is 1.5.x, so the build files should be added to `./1.5` directory of this repository.
